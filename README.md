### 2. Media Management
Dedicated module for organizing visual resources. It supports dynamic previewing with **zoom** controls and exposes file metadata such as capture date and original format.

### 3. Note Analytics
Calculation engine for individual productivity metrics. It tracks precise data on active editing time, word count, work sessions, and the **lexical diversity** of the content.

### 4. Topic-Level Aggregated Metrics
Unlike individual analysis, this component consolidates information from all elements within a category. It evaluates the **total effort** per knowledge area, accounting for accumulated time and entity density (notes and images).

## 💡 Motivation

This project was born out of a personal need: **to organize the chaos**. My desktop and my ideas were scattered, and I needed a tool to centralize my thoughts in one place.

Beyond solving a real productivity problem, **SecondBrain** is a conscious exercise in software engineering, where I applied best practices in architecture, component decoupling, and maintainable code.
